<li> <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/clementsarrazin/home"> Clément Sarrazin</a>. Since November 2023, Clément has been working on the project <b> Calibration of pathogen spread models on graphs
using Optimal Transport </b> financed by the Institut des Mathématiques pour la Planète Terre (IMPT, CNRS), which I lead jointly with <a href="https://gaelbn.com/"> Gaël Beaunée </a> (INRAE).
The project aims to construct Optimal Transport metrics specifically adapted to the types of data that are used in epidemiological models (multi-species, partial observations) and to use these to infer the models' unknown parameters. Clément was recruited (starting in September 2024) as a maître de conférence at the IMT Nord Europe (Lille), but he is still involved in the project.  </li> 
<li> <a href="https://enricofacca.github.io/">Enrico Facca</a>. Enrico was supported by an Inria postdoctoral grant from October 2021 to March 2023. His project dealt with the design of efficient interior point algorithms to solve Dynamical Optimal Transport problems. He obtained a Marie Skłodowska-Curie postdoctoral fellowship <a href="https://www.uib.no/en/vista-csd/165005/network-inpainting-optimal-transport-niot"> Network Impanting with Optimal Transport (NIOT)</a> at the University of Bergen, where he is still working on similar models but for brain imaging reconstruction problems. </li>

<ul style="text-align:justify">
<li> (2004) Master internship (3 months) of Alonso Salvador Carrasco Urbina (Universidad Técnica Federico Santa María, Chile), financed by Inria Chile. The project dealt on the development of numerical algorithms for the Wasserstein extrapolation problem.</li> 
<li> (2023) M2 internship (6 months) of Sam Dossin co-supervised with Maxime Herda (Inria Rapsodi) and Gaël Beaunée (INRAE). This internship was financed by the INRAE project <a href="https://digitbio.hub.inrae.fr/rubriques-verticales2/nos-actions/projets-exploratoires/projet-exploratoire-midiivec-2022-2024"> MIDIIVEC </a>, of which I was member and which ran from 2022 to 2024. The project dealt with the modelling and inference of intra-vector virus dynamics, mainly in mosquitoes. </li> 
<li> (2023) M1 internship (3 months) of Ivan Tagliaferro de Oliveira Tezoto, co-supervise with Maxime Herda (Inria Lille). The project concerned the numerical simulation of a non-local diffusion model in epidemiology.</li> 
<li> (2022) M1 internship (6 months - half time) of Thomas Gaviard, co-supervised with Claire Chainais-Hillairait (Université de Lille, Inria) on the development of particle methods for linear diffusion models.</li> 
<li> (2021) M1 internship (3 months) of Joël Drappier on the development of a finite element discretization for variational mean-field games.</li> 
</ul>
